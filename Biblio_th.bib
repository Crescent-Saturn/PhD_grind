  abstract  = {Thermography is now commonly used as a tool for the qualitative inspection
	of buildings, for different purposes such as energy monitoring, moisture
	mapping and many others. All these controls need to correctly locate
	in space the different phenomena observed and evaluate the area affected
	by the phenomena. Furthermore, when thermography is applied quantitatively
	and fluxes are evaluated, the precise area affected by the process
	is of paramount importance. This paper intends to approach the issue
	to obtain a correct three-dimensional reconstruction of the building
	that will promptly integrate all the information to the surface,
	such as wall temperature, optical absorption coefficient, etc. 
	
	For this purpose, at first the influence of the visual and IR optics
	calibration is addressed. After that, sets of images taken in the
	visible and infrared spectrum are processed for the geometric correction,
	mosaicing and 3D reconstruction. The ultimate output is a 3D model
	of the object implemented with matching sets of data (e.g. temperature,
	heat flux, etc.) allowing an easy visualization and their correct
	positioning in space. The main result of this process is the capability
	of quantitative analysis of thermal processes acting on the building.},

  abstract  = {IR thermography applied in a proper way is able to detect very accurately
	temperature difference between air 
	
	and surfaces. By means of this tool is now possible to analyse the
	local instantaneous heat flux through the 
	
	surface of a building. In case of steady thermal state, this gives
	the thermal performance evaluation of the 
	
	building envelope. In case of a transient condition an averaging process
	or a system identification algorithm 
	
	must be applied on time-series of such a data. In any case, it is
	demonstrated that a standard technique based 
	
	on thermal flux meter for the thermal resistance (R-value) measurements
	is more affected by errors than 
	
	thermographic measurements using this new approach. 
	
	The method is illustrated with experimental results obtained into
	a residential building. A dedicated 
	
	thermographic apparatus is used to map the temperature of the indoor
	surface of an internal wall and to 
	
	measure in same positions the air temperature at 10 cm from the surface.
	From these data the local heat flux 
	
	is detected at any point of the internal surface. A conventional thermogram
	of the corresponding outside 
	
	surface or the outdoor air temperature history allows an easy way
	to achieve both thermal conductance and 
	
	transmittance of the investigated wall. 
	
	In this way it is possible the evaluation of both radiative and convective
	heat flux on a local basis with a 
	
	space resolution of 1 cm. The results are here presented within a
	comparison with the local measurement 
	
	with a thermal flux-meter device. These results are important in order
	to enhance energy efficiency and 
	
	comfort in buildings.},

	fluid plenum height is less than 500 Œºm. For a 2 mm channeland the

	thermal performance of insulated containers. The method is illustrated
	with experimental results obtained into a test tunnel working under
	
	
	controlled environmental conditions. Insulated vehicles are tested
	in parallel according to the accepted standard ‚ÄúAgreement on the
	international carriage of perishable foodstuffÔøΩ? (ATP) and the thermographic
	method. A thermographic apparatus is used to map the temperature
	of the external walls of the insulated box.
	
	
	Defective zones are identified and the local heat flux mapped basing
	on a heat flux meter measurement in a reference point and on the
	thermographic temperature maps. 
	
	The proposed thermographic method allows also determining thermal
	bridges magnitude and air leakages location. These results are important
	in order to enhance manufacture. 
	
	Some experimental data are presented in order to compare K-values
	measured along ATP rules and calculated by the thermographic inspection.
	The comparison allows verifying the accuracy. 
	
	Such a quality test is particularly useful for periodic control of
	insulation ageing.},
